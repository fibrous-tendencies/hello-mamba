#### Hello Mamba | Environment Setup and Testing

Welcome to GitHub! GitHub is a platform that allows you to store and share code with others. The method for downloading code from GitHub is called cloning. If you have not cloned a repository aka repo before then you can follow the instructions below to do so. 

### Step 1: Clone the repository

Once you are in the repository, you should see a green button that says "Code". Click on that button and you should see a URL. Copy that URL using the copy button.

It should look like this:

Now go and open github desktop. Go to file -> clone repository. Make sure you are on the 'URL' tab and paste the URL you copied into the 'Repository URL' box. Choose a location on your computer where you want to save the repository and click 'Clone'. Generally you can just leave the path as it is, unless you have some specific reason to change it. 

Now you should see the repository in your github desktop. If you get a popup, you can just accept whichever option makes the most sense for you.

Finally you can click the button that says 'Open in Visual Studio Code' to open the repository in your code editor. If you are using a different code editor you may need to change the default application that opens the repo. Instructions for how to do this are [here](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/configuring-and-customizing-github-desktop/configuring-a-default-editor-in-github-desktop).

The process should look like this:

### Step 2: Open the notebook

In the file explorer on the left side of the screen there will be a file called HelloMamba.ipynb. Click on this file to open it. You should see the notebook open in a new tab. You can now follow the instructions in the notebook to set up your environment and install the necessary packages.
